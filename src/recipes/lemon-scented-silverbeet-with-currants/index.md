This is a simple and effective way of livening up a humble plate of silverbeet. The mellow fruitiness of the olive oil is brightened by the lemon juice, and the currants add little bursts of sweetness to each mouthful.

Serves 2-3 as a side

  * 1 bunch silverbeet, rinsed, stems removed and coarsely chopped
  * 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
  * 2 tablespoons currants
  * 1 teaspoon lemon juice

Heat olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add silverbeet and lemon juice and toss to coat silverbeet with the lemon and oil. I like to add the currants now too, as cooking them with the silverbeet will make them nice and juicy. Cook, stirring frequently, until silverbeet is just wilted, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.
