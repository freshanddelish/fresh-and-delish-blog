Figs are in season and abundant at the Farmers’ Market; as I adore fresh figs I find this very exciting. Having bought two bags of figs at the markets last weekend, I recalled fondly some very tasty fig and brie mini pizzas I made for a dinner party a few years ago. I wanted a healthier option to the pizza base though, so paired the toppings with some linseed meal crackers. The only thing is, I need your help to name them. The best I can come up with is ‘Toasted fig, brie, balsamic caramelised onion and walnut linseed slices’ which, while descriptive, is a little long. So, have a go at making these and suggest a new name in the comments section.

Makes about 20

Linseed crackers:

  * olive oil
  * 2 cups linseed meal
  * 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt
  * a few pinches pepper
  * 1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped, or 1/2 teaspoon dried
  * 1/4 teaspoon dried sage

Toppings:

  * 2 tablespoons olive oil
  * 3 red onions, sliced
  * 1 tablespoon golden syrup or honey
  * 2-3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
  * 10 fresh figs, quartered
  * 100g brie, cut into 20 wedges
  * 1/2 cup walnuts, broken into pieces or coarsely chopped

Make the linseed crackers:

Preheat oven to 180˚C (350 F), and lightly oil one large or two smaller baking tray(s). Combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Stir in 1 cup water. Spread mix over the tray(s) and top with a sheet of baking paper. Use a rolling pin to roll out the mixture until it is about 5mm thick. Press in the edges so they are not too much thinner than the middle or else they’ll burn before the rest firms up. Remove the paper and bake in the oven until crackers are firm on the surface (they’ll still be a bit soft in the middle, but will harden as they cool), and starting to brown around the edges, 15-20 minutes.

Score into squares and use a spatula to remove crackers to a cooling rack.

Meanwhile, caramelise the onions:

Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and add the onions. Cook until the onions soften and begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir in the vinegar and golden syrup or honey. Cook until onions are very soft and liquid has thickened, maybe another 15-20 minutes. Taste and adjust with a little extra vinegar or sweetener as needed.

To complete:

Return linseed crackers to the baking tray. Top each cracker with a heaped tablespoon of caramelised onion, two fig quarters, a slice of brie and finally a teaspoon of walnut pieces. Bake at 180˚C until brie has melted and walnuts are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Enjoy immediately.
